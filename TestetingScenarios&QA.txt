Updated saved memory
Awesome, Dnyaneshwari! Since you’re handling testing for the User Internal Chat Option hackathon project, let’s break this down into manageable pieces so you’re fully prepared — from cross-questioning to test cases and the PPT presentation.

✅ 1. Cross-Questioning (QA Perspective)
These questions help clarify requirements, spot ambiguities, and uncover edge cases:

🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Does the chat module require re-authentication, or will it reuse session tokens?

Are roles like Admin, User, or Guest defined? Who can message whom?

📱 Real-time Features
What happens if a user is offline when a message is sent?

Is message delivery guaranteed? (retry mechanisms, delivery receipts?)

Should we show "seen" or "delivered" indicators?

💬 Chat Functions
Is there a limit on message size or media file size?

Can users delete or edit messages? What about recall?

Is chat persistent across sessions?

💾 Data & Security
Is chat data encrypted at rest and in transit?

Who can access chat logs? Is there a moderation/logging system?

⚙️ UI/UX & Performance
What is the expected number of concurrent users?

Will mobile responsiveness be tested? Or just web?

🧪 2. Positive & Negative Test Scenarios
✅ Positive Test Cases

ID	Scenario	Expected Outcome

TC04	Group chat initiated	Messages visible to all group members
TC05	User uploads file (if feature is there)	File uploads and appears in chat window
TC06	User logs in from another browser	Messages sync properly
TC07	User searches past messages	Accurate results shown
❌ Negative Test Cases

ID	Scenario	Expected Outcome
TC08	User sends empty message	"Send" disabled or error shown
TC09	User sends unsupported file type	Upload blocked, error shown
TC10	Network disconnects while chatting	Message fails with retry option
TC11	User with revoked access tries to chat	Access denied error shown
TC12	SQL injection/HTML script in message	Input sanitized, no execution
🔄 3. WebSocket Testing Tips

Test scenarios:

Connection establishment & termination

Reconnection logic on failure

Message ordering

ChatGPT said:
Great! Being prepared for the Q&A round is crucial, especially in a hackathon where testers are often challenged to demonstrate depth of understanding, testing strategy, and real-time problem-solving. Here's an in-depth list of questions that might be asked, along with strong answers tailored for your role as a tester in this in-app chat system project.

🧠 General QA Questions
1. How did you verify WebSocket functionality?
Answer:

I verified WebSocket connectivity using browser dev tools (Network > WS tab) to observe connection frames.

Sent messages through the UI and monitored onmessage and onclose events.

Simulated network drops to ensure reconnect logic.

Used test users in separate browsers to ensure bi-directional real-time communication.

Verified message order and ensured no duplication.

2. How would this scale to 1,000+ users?
Answer:

From a tester's perspective, I would recommend:

Load testing WebSocket connections using tools like Gatling or Apache JMeter with WebSocket plugin.

Observing message delivery time, order, and system CPU/memory under load.

Ensuring no crashes, slowdowns, or message loss under concurrent users.

Backend should use STOMP over WebSocket with RabbitMQ for scalability (if applicable).

3. How did you test the chat when one user is offline?
Answer:

Sent messages while user B was offline.

Verified that messages were queued/stored in the database.

Upon B’s login, ensured proper delivery with timestamp, unread count, and notifications.

Also tested scenarios with partial message delivery due to logout during conversation.

4. How did you ensure messages aren’t lost or duplicated?
Answer:

Checked message IDs in DB to avoid duplicates.

Verified acknowledgement system (if implemented) via WebSocket.

Simulated network failures to ensure retry/resend logic.

5. How did you validate message order?
Answer:

Sent multiple messages in quick succession from User A to B.

Compared timestamps and IDs in both frontend and backend DB to verify ordering.

6. How did you test notifications (in-app or push)?
Answer:

Triggered message send event while receiver was in another chat or inactive tab.

Verified UI badge counter, sound, and/or pop-up.

(For mobile) Would suggest integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (if scope allowed).

7. What edge cases did you consider for message input?
Answer:

Very long messages (>1000 characters).

Special characters, emojis, and non-English input (Unicode support).

Sending HTML/JS code (to test XSS protection).

Empty or whitespace-only messages.

8. What security checks did you perform?
Answer:

JWT token validation during socket handshake.

Checked for message injection, URL tampering, and unauthorized access to others' chats.

Sent invalid token manually and ensured access denial.

Validated input encoding to avoid XSS or SQL injection.

9. How did you test user presence (online/offline/away)?
Answer:

Observed presence indicators in UI when user connected/disconnected.

Verified real-time updates across multiple sessions/devices.

Idle timeout tested for "away" status (if implemented).

10. How did you test file sharing (if included)?
Answer:

Uploaded various file types and sizes.

Verified preview, download, and storage.

Tried uploading unsupported formats and received appropriate error messages.

11. What would be your test strategy if message delivery fails?
Answer:

Retry logic validation on frontend.

Server logs for error tracing.

Verify if failed messages were stored for retry.

Alert/notification shown to sender about delivery failure.

how to remove highlighted text using weava highliter


ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it! If you're using Weava Highlighter (a browser extension often used to highlight and organize research content on web pages), here's how you can remove a highlight:

✅ Steps to Remove Highlight in Weava:
🔹 Option 1: Directly on the Web Page
Hover over the highlighted text.

You’ll see a Weava popup toolbar with options.

Click on the trash can icon 🗑️ – this will delete the highlight.

🔹 Option 2: From the Weava Dashboard
Go to the Weava Dashboard: https://weavatools.com/dashboard

Open the project or folder where your highlight is saved.

Find the specific highlight you want to remove.

Click on the three dots (⋮) next to the highlight.

Choose "Delete".

🔁 Optional Tips:
If you're trying to change the color instead of removing, just hover and use the color picker icon instead of the trash can.

If the Weava popup isn’t appearing, make sure the extension is active and you’re logged in.

Let me know if you’re using it inside a specific website or PDF viewer, and I’ll tailor the steps further!
